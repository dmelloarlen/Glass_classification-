Firstly, we clean the data
the process of data cleaning is handled by Jenil Mistry

Data Cleaning : 

The first thing we did was check whether there are any null values or not.
then we checked for any duplicated in the file.
we converted all the float64 values into int64.

there were no null values in the csv file.
there was 1 duplicated value in the csv file and we dropped it.  
converted all columns to int64 by using astype function.
//Data Anaylsis
In this step we read the data and analysis was done
In analysis we found min and max of quality using min /max function
//Data Representation
In this step we made representation using streamlit and matplotlib libaries of python
